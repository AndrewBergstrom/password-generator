# password-generator


Description: A password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for password length. The user must pick any number of characters between 8-128. If the user does not pick a valuation within that range then the user is prompted with and error telling them the number of characters must be between 8-128. Then the user must try again to enter a correct value. 

Next, the program runs through a series of prompts asking the user to define if they would like to include special characters, lowercase letters,  uppercase letters and numbers. If the user selects no defining parameters, then the program will prompt a message telling the user to select at least one defining parameter and will cycle back through each prompt.

After at least one parameter has been defined, the new password will appear.
